# Trakm8 Coding Challenge

This repository contains solutions for the Trakm8 coding challenge, which consists of three tasks designed to evaluate problem-solving skills using TypeScript and Node.js.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Sequence Generator
- **Description**: Write a function that outputs the n-th element of a sequence defined by `An = A(n-1) + A(n-2)` for all `n > 2`, given the first two elements of the sequence `A1` and `A2`, and the index `n`.

### Task 2: Word Reverser and Character Replacer
- **Description**: Create a function that takes an array of strings, reverses the order of words in each element, and replaces sequences of the same character in any word with asterisks of the same length.

### Task 3: Number Divisibility
- **Description**: Implement a function that checks each integer in an array for divisibility by 3 and 11 with specific methods and returns a new array with 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbuzz', or 'baz' based on the results.
